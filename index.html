My first memories were watching a <a href="http://youtu.be/yCYf1jtnHmw" target="_blank"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em></a> cartoon after school at 4 years old. Ever since then I&rsquo;ve loved cartoons. From cartoons I started drawing other cartoons, this gave me an interest in art, illustration, and comic books and sequential art. 
		</p><p class="indent">At around age 13 I started taking fine art classes at the <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/education/" target="_blank"><em>Brooklyn Museum</em></a>. Every Saturday morning I would take these classes and it help me appreciate fine art and it&rsquo;s history.</p>
		<h2><span class="shadowH2">I F*@KING LOVE MOVIES!</span></h2>
		<p class="flushleft"><span class="DropCap-Orange">Q</span><span class="Boldcaps"><strong>uoting</strong></span> movies is my favorite thing to do with friends. If you are able to catch any quotes that I&rsquo;ve dropped from The Big Lebowski, then rest assured you are a good friend of mine. For me movies are like social currency, much like what sports is to most people.<br /> Movies tell me who you are and what you are interested in. In my opinion there&rsquo;s a movie out there for everyone.</p>
		<p class="indent">Here are my top 12 list of movies I love to talk about. <br />Q.&#160;But George, why 12 and not 10 movies? Shouldn't it be 10 or 15 to make it a nice round number?<br />
		<em>A.&#160;Shut up... That's why.</em></p>
